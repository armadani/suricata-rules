# Suricata Rules

This repository contains a large collection of rules for the Suricata intrusion detection system (IDS). Suricata is an open-source network IDS that can detect a wide range of threats, including malware, exploits, and other malicious activity. Our rules are designed to be highly effective at detecting web application attack.
